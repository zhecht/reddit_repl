dj19c8b;;1497722695.0;;4431;;Solar Superflares...\n\nbasically, it is a huge solar flare that probably hasn't happened in our Solar System. But we have observed stars that have weaker magnetic fields than the Sun that exhibit superflares. The largest solar flare that we have recorded was **the carrington event**. It happened in 1859 and was so strong, it could be seen with the naked eye and even set telegraph systems on fire. \n\nThat was only 1/10,000 the energy of the largest known superflares. If one were to happen, the effects are pretty grim.\n\n- airline passengers would receive high-doses of radiation\n- all satellites would be damaged, but probably broken\n- the ozone layer would be fucked\n- loss of most radio communications \n- and for a strong one, the Sun's luminosity increase could cause ice to melt as far as the moons of Jupiter

Learned about it on 99pi mini-stories podcast [here](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/mini-stories-volume-6/). But basically apartments and retail wanted to extend their properties as far as legally possible. So instead of alleys, we get cramped studios to maximize profit.\n\n[Cortlandt alley](https://untappedcities-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Cortlandt-Alley-Chinatow-Soho-NYC.jpg) is what you think of when hearing NYC alley. But this alley though is solely used for filming. So there's this really interesting chicken and egg problem where directors want the essence of NY alley but those don't actually exist so they further the myth by filming at this location. So many shows/movies use this exact alleyway and actually professionally clean it up and order fake trash to make it look like a manhattan alley.\n\ngrew up in NY for 18 years and this blew me away

John was same age as Rivers (23) at the time\n\n- After quitting RHCP in 91/92 ... From 1993-1997, he went into a huge period of constantly shooting up Heroin and not wanting to live anymore. Flea and a few other friends did everything they could, but he had his mind set on dying.\n\n- Somehow, and thank fuck, he came out alive. He had to have a lot of his skin removed and transferred to other parts of his body for incorrectly shooting Heroin. You can search for his wrist tattoo before/after pics to see the difference\n\n- Johnny Depp directed and produced [a really short film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWBj7NR338Y) on John's life during this time. It's called Stuff and it's a look inside John's apartment in 1993. It's a pretty insane look in the mind of a Heroin user. fucked up stuff.

It's not the same and hasn't been since Season 4 (May 2018) in my opinion. \n\nWhat it's become now sucks. People like you just flat out hate it, parents hate it, schools hate it. But also the community hates it right now, **especially** the competitive folks.\n\nAn article came out discussing how shitty the devs have it and are overworked to hell. So no one is happy! It really goes to show that Epic was not prepared for the influx of people.\n\nI really miss the beginning of fortnite, when it was buggy, everyone was bad, there were barely any streamers, and no-one did fucking dances in public. \n\nIt was just an amazing world built on a great engine that Epic owned with a crazy new mechanic. Building. It was such a refreshing change to shooters that no other game had.\n\nThe progress of watching people never build to only building one wall to the ramp age to building towers today is pretty nuts to think back on. The mechanics of the shooter itself is noooot good at all. So building is why I really love it. People get really creative.\n\nThanks for listening, have a great Friday.

etyj0ud;;1563318656.0;;47;;[quantum eraser experiment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ORLN_KwAgs)\n\nif you're familiar with the Double-Slit experiment, which has very interesting results, the quantum eraser takes it to a whole different level\n\nScientists basically "trick" the particle using awesome glass and light properties. And give the appearance that they are not observing which slit the particle goes through, when in reality, they set up the experiment in a way where they can view which slit. and the results are really crazy, recommend the PBS Space Time video\n\n----------------------------------------\n\n*****i'll try to tldw it if you don't have 14min. bear with me, confusing shit. Gonna be very lost if you don't know about the double-slit experiment so good intro [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-MNSLsjjdo). okay. ELI25\n\nIf you're familiar with some quantum, you know that when you randomly fire particles like photons through a [double-slit setup](https://i.imgur.com/zaKhUwl.png), they will produce an [interference pattern](https://i.imgur.com/V6W7c2K.png). This is what a wave (like a light bulb) produces in this experiment.\n\nBut if we use a detector to view which slit the particle actually goes through, we get a [clump](https://i.imgur.com/j7g8Jp8.png). one for each slit. If the detector is between the double-slit and the laser, it's called **which choice** experiment.\n\nThe same results hold true if the detector is placed *behind* the double-slit. Is it possible that the particles after going through the slit, "realize" they're being detected and produce the clump pattern? This experiment is called the **delayed choice**\n\n**Quantum Eraser**\n\n[The Setup](https://i.imgur.com/tEz2cZN.png). The tilted glass beneath A/B are *special crystals that absorb the photon and produce two new photons, with half the energy*. When A or B light up, you start to see just a random set of dots appear, no interference pattern. Because we know which slit each particle is going through.\n\nThe **Quantum Eraser** part is C/D. The crystals are switched out for mirrors so that 50% of photons will pass through and reach the *eraser part*.\n\nIf we only look at the detectors from C & D, we see the [interference pattern](https://i.imgur.com/4kEJPGS.png). So A & B are still lighting up the same, but just by scrambling the information about which detector lights up, we see the wave pattern.\n\n> I did my best, hope this helped somebody learn about some crazy stuff

esp5008;;1562178998.0;;38;;I like this one. the logic is basically\n\nvideo games are starting to become indistinguishable from reality. It's not crazy to think that with advances in AR, VR, and hardware, video games in the future will feel almost exactly like reality\n\nWhich is great. Scientists can test treatments and medicine on the "humans" in the simulation and replicate the exact environment that's needed\n\nBut on the other hand, all it takes is one scientist / engineer to develop a simulation to simulate life. Now the "humans" in that simulation will have no concept of the **base simulation** they were created from and think that their reality is the true reality.\n\nSo out of all the possible universes that we can create in the future, are we the base universe? Statistics say no shot.

Now I get a trap kill once every few games. Couple of the biggest things i've learned trap wise....\n\n- 1) when fighting inside a building and the enemy runs into a room. Place a trap on the ground and close the door\n\n- 2) When ramping up in a build fight, try ramping above your opponent and corner them by placing a floor for them to be stuck in. Then close off the walls and place the trap\n

So I went along to the show. That’s how I first met Flea and John. I think I offered my drumming to them. John and I didn’t become friends until a couple of years later. He had already rejoined the Red Hot Chili Peppers by then. I was making a record with the Bicycle Thief and John came and did a solo on the record. We started hanging out. I’d go over his house and listen to records. So we started becoming friends around 1999.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**Or Flea worrying about John's solo bc he was stoned**\n\n"We were rocking and he's supposed to do a big solo -- I look over and he's hitting his fucking weed pipe behind his amp!\n\nI said, "Dude, it's your solo and you're tokin up?!"

Spoilers ahead! Basically, an artist in the late 60's came out with 2 records that flopped hard in the US. Like less than 20 records sold flopping.\n\nThe people who produced his music never understood why, comparing the writing to as good as Dylan at the time.

John and I didn’t become friends until a couple of years later. He had already rejoined the Red Hot Chili Peppers by then. I was making a record with the Bicycle Thief and John came and did a solo on the record. We started hanging out. I’d go over his house and listen to records.

evuo7o0;;1564800936.0;;15;;**Run us through the amps you use.**\n\nI've been playing this Joe Dart bass through a Markbass rig. I've got the Markbass Tube and I love it. It has a transparency that allows you to hear everything you're doing warmed up, rounded out, punchy, deep, but at the same time without any added character that isn't already comingg out of your fingers. So, to me, it's like it's not hyper-moder, but it's not hyper-old-school either. I really think they nailed it. And they're also light as hell. It's amazing, carrying a 4x10 up a set of stairs, you really notice.\n\n**Any effects?**\n\nI don't have a pedal rig at the moment.\n\n**Straight in?**\n\nStraight in, yeah. And that's how we do it in the studio, too, direct bass. Nothing to hide behind, and one volume knob. It's about as minimal as you can  get- four strings, a volume knob, direct into the amp.\n\n**What advice do you have for us about how to evolve as a bass player?**\n\nMy advice is always develop good time, and build good stamina to be able to play with good time throughout the whole song. Stamina will come, and in the meantime you can learn vocabulary by listening to great bass players. To me, the one thing that you absolutely can't skip on, especially when you're young and just learning, is developing great time, because you're going to play with a bunch of different drummers throughout your life. Every one is going to put the time somewhere else, and you should be able to always be the bridge between the drummer and the rest of the band and make it feel good. That's a huge thing I think about when I think about what I want to practice.\n\n**Jack Bruce said the job of the bass player is to make the drummer sound good.**\n\nI love it. That's great. That's fantastic. Theo Katzman always says that playing bass is playing drums on a guitar. It has that percussive element, and you're really digging in, and it can be really phyiscal, but you're playing on a harmonic instrument, and so you really do have tobridge those two things. That's why I feel that time is so important.\n\n**What's coming up for Vulfpeck?**\n\nWe've got an exciting 2019. We'll  get together in some cool studios and put a record out in the fall, and we've got a couple of bucket list tour experiences: Madison Square Garden in September, which I still can't believe is real, and Red Rocks in the spring. Between those, I can almost die a happy man.

dv9mwr2;;1520347685.0;;13;;shoutout to /u/Farts-McGee for this.\n\nSome highlights for me\n\n- **CapiTaliSaTion** Randomly capitalize the first letter of a syllable in the middle of a word. For example ComputeRasterHistoGram().\n\n- **Recycling Revisited** Use scoping as confusingly as possible by recycling variable names in contradictory ways. For example, suppose you have global variables A and B, and functions foo and bar. If you know that variable A will be regularly passed to foo and B to bar, make sure to define the functions as function foo(B) and function bar(A) so that inside the functions A will always be referred to as B and vice versa. With more functions and globals, you can create vast confusing webs of mutually contradictory uses of the same names.\n\n- **Conventions Schmentions** Ignore the Sun Java Coding Conventions, after all, Sun does. Fortunately, the compiler won't tattle when you violate them. The goal is to come up with names that differ subtlely only in case. If you are forced to use the capitalisation conventions, you can still subvert wherever the choice is ambigous, e.g. use both inputFilename and inputfileName. Invent your own hopelessly complex naming conventions, then berate everyone else for not following them.

evuo6sy;;1564800915.0;;11;;**Is it rewarding to get this level of recognition from the bass community, Joe?**\n\nIt's the coolest thing for me. When I hear young bass players come up to me after your shows and say, "You're the reason I started", or "You're the reason I stuck with it", that's the highest honour for me.\n\n**How log have you been playing bass?**\n\nI started when I was about eight years old. When my dad realised that he had five children, all of whom love music as kids, he said, "Well, why don't we have a family band?" We literally had one instrument assigned to each of us, and a basement with a drum set, a bass, a guitar and keys.\n\n**He sounds like a cool dad.**\n\nThe coolest. So about age eight, I had a Samick bass with action about a foot high, and luckily, developed my finger strength and dexterity on a bass that was impossible to play. The second bass I ever got was a Fender, then the third bass I got was a Music Man.\n\n**Where did you grow up?**\n\nI grew up in northern Michigan, the middle of nowhere - you would think it would not be a musical hotbed, but there were a couple of grerat bass players from Detroit, Chicago and even New York. They would be Michiganders origginally, move out to the coast to play, and decide to semi-retire.\n\n**Any names we would know?**\n\nProbably not. These guys were all working bass players in New York and LA in the 80s and 90s, and when they had kids and a family, they thought, "Maybe we'll go back to the Midwest". They would teach at the local music shop, they would gig on the weekends at the local pub. I would see them play on the weekend, and then have a lesson with them during the week. They were great teachers and great players, and they steered me down the funk bass track.\n\n**Why do you prefer that style?**\n\nIt was a confluence of the influences of my parents and my bass teachers, who happened to be in the sphere of funk music. My mom and dad loved Stevie Wonder and Prince. My mom say Prince, like, four times. We had this music on around the house. I remember as a kid dancing around the living room to Prince, Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder. My bass teachers realised that as a young bass player, nothing will get you excited like a band that features the bass prominently. For me, that was the Red Hot Chili Peppers, and then later Earth, Wind & Fire, Sly & The Family Stone. I fell in love with it.\n\n**You use a super-tight, Rocco Prestia-type picking stlye**\n\nOne of my hereos. When i think back to starting to play bass, I could have learned using one finger, two fingers, three fingers, or a pick, but it just so happened that my primary teacher was a two-finger bass player. The downside of that is I don't have the full three-finger dexterity. I also didn't learn the kind of Victor-style slap thing. I learned the Flea-style slap thing. But the Rocco 16ths muted thing just spoke to me.\n\n**How did you meet the other Vulfpeck musicians?**\n\nWhen I came down to Ann Arbor, where the University of Michigan musical school is, I saw an amazing band called My Dear Disco, which was a synth-pop band with a synth player on one side and an organ player on the other, a great singer, a great dummer, bass player and guitarist. Two of the guys in the band would later go on to be my bandmates, my friends, in Vulfpeck. At the time I was just a high schooler at a sold-out show in a college town, just losing it over this band. I couldn't believe their energy and their songs. Those guys were Theo Katzman, who plays drums and sings in Vulfpeck, and Joey Dosik, who is a great singer-songwriter in his own right, who also plays with Vulfpeck. I would never have guessed that, after being at that show as a high schooler and being inspired to come to that school, that I would end up playing with those guys. It was so fortuitous. I decided to go to U of M for that reason, and met [bandleader] Jack Stratton after that. \n\n**What did you study?**\n\nJazz bass. I was one of the few guys who came playing electric bass. Pretty much everyone else was on upright. If any kid comes up to me and says, "Should I go to music school?" I would say, "Yes, absolutely". They don't ask me, "Should I finish music school?" or "Should I get a degree in music?" which is a different thing. But I went to music school, met my future bandmates, and it never would have happened if I hadn't gone.\n\n**Did you complete your degree?**\n\nI didn't. I left in 2010 to hit the road with the very band that I saw in high school that inspired me to go to U of M. That was My Dear Disco. When I met Stratton, he had a college  funk band called Groove Spoon, and they were looking for a new bass player. Thatt band had a lead singer named Antwaun Stanley, who has gone on to feature in Vulfpeck. Jack and I started playing together, great funk music that Jack was composing, but we were also a great wedding band, with a fantastic horn section, all music-school guys. We would play Earth, Wind & Fire, and we would play Stevie, and all that music that I grew up listening to learning. I finally got to play with a band that could really play it and it was fun.\n\n**When did Vulfpeck come along?**\n\nIn 2011, Stratton invited me to play the first session of the band that would later become Vulfpeck. I didn't know what it would be; I dodn't think any of us did.  Stratton had a bit of a vision, but I think even he had no idea what it would turn into. We played a session for our buddy's college project. He was recording straight to tape and his thesis was, "I'm going to make a straight-to-tape recording in the school studios, and I'm going to hire a crack team of studio musicians from town to play on it". That was Stratton, me, Katzman, and Goss. Little did I know that we were making the first Vulfpeck record. We ended up making three more of those, which are little six-track EPs, over the next three years, and since then a studio record every year.\n\n**You've come a long way.**\n\nWhen I look back at it now, we haven't been a band for 10 years yet, and this year we're going to play Red Rocks and Madison Square Garden. I couldn't be more stoked. I feel so lucky because this is exactly what I wanted. When I came to music school, I wanted to find a band to join, I hoped that we would make some records and do some tours and chase the dream. Vulfpeck has done that in our strange way, and now we're playing some real shows, we're playing some real tours, and we've made some cool records, and I hope the slow and steady progress continues for a long time because it's still really fun.\n\n**have you always been a musician in that time?**\n\nyou know, there were times where the bank account got really low, but I found a way to make music my living since college. That's probably the main bit of good fortune. I feel very lucky to say today that I can write "musician" on the occupation line of a form.\n\n**Let's talk bass gear.**\n\nWhen I started with Vulfpeck, I was playing the one bass I owned, a Fender Jazz. Since then, I've picked up a handful of axes that Stratton owns for this or that session. If something had a more Jamerson bent to it, Stratton's little Squier P-Bass might do the trick. For a long time the biggest song that Vulfpeck recorded, "Beastly", was on that bass.\n\n**When did you switch to Ernie Bell?**\n\nWhat happened was that I played Stratton's Music Man clone on a Vulfpeck track called "It Gets Funkierr". That was probably the best tone we ever got on a Vulfpeck track, and so after that we thought we should probably get the real thing. We borrowed a Stingray, we borrowed a Sterlingg Classic, and played those on a few Vulf tracks to great effect, but even then still didn't own one until Ernie Ball reached out to me and said, "Hey, do you want to come demo some of these new basses we have?" I flew out to San Luis Obispo, where I demoed some of the axes. I loved them, and they said, "If you want one, i think we can hook you up". That's how I got my first Ernie Ball axe, about three years ago.\n\n**Which leads us to your new Joe Dart signature bass, which sold out its 50-unit run really fast**\n\nWe became friends, me and the guys at Ernie Ball, and we were talking one day and they said, "We'd love to make you a custom bass if you've got any ideas for a unique instrument". Stratton and I had been talking abou that exact bass that I told you about that I played on "It Gets Funkier", which was a cheap Music Man copy. Stratton and I said, "What if we could build one that felt and looked like that, except good?" So we took that idea and ran with it. We brought thtem the copy and my Jazz bass, and we said, "Let's make a hybrid of these two".\n\n**Tell us about the spec.**\n\nIt has one knob, one pickup, and it's passive. The whole thing started out as Jack's idea. He calls it the single-speed bass. Me and Jack both fell overr when I took it out of the box, because they completely nailed it. It's exactly what we envisioned, to a point where to see it in the real world, even right now, is pretty surreal. I've gotten a lot of great comments abou it along the road. I took the prototype that we built out on a couple of tours, and it's been funny to see people taking a closer look. We wanted flatwounds that have a brightness to them and give you that really old-school disco tone. It's a very sweet little axe. It's very much my childhood dream. It's cool to see something that's only in your mind come into being and be a physical thing. The look of the one know, one pickup, white on wood - I haven't seen anything like it. We feel like we brought something new into this world.

With that triumph, plus a new signature bass from Ernie Ball and a fantastic year ahead for Vulfpeck, therre's little wonder that Dart is a happy man when we sit down for a bass-heavy chat... [Interview Joel McIver]\n\nI've got to say, between having my name on the headstock of a music man and being on the cover of this magazine -- These are bucket-list moments for me...\n\n"...I'm feeling very lucky. Thank you. It's an incredible honour."\n\nNo need to thank us, Joe - thank the thousands of votes who made you the top of our recent poll. And, of course, the many fans of Vulfpeck who have elevated the California-based band from an obscure funk college outfit to one of the most geniuinely exciting creative forces operating today.\n\nThe occasional negative comment is thrown at Vulfpeck when their name comes up online, where they've primarily been exposed until now (although that's changing thanks to you, readers). Criticism of the band usually involves the word 'hipsters', which instantly reveals the middle-aged demographic of the critics, an age range that I and most of this magazine's staff sharer - but any serious analysis of the group and its music reveals that they're as far from a flash-in-the-pan fashion trend as you can get. In bass terms alone, those who know the subject - such as our friends at No Treble and elsewhere - recognised Dart's phenomenally funky skills as far back as their first appearances in 2011.\n\nFour albums, four EPs and a clutch of Spotify releases later - including the brilliant, music-free *Sleepify* of 2014, designed to game the streaming system - Vulfpeck are established as the thinking musician's funk band for the third decade of tthis century. When we sat down with Dart, still only 27, it's clear that those rewards have been gained thanks to much hard work as well as talent.
